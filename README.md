# ANUBiS
* **A**ssemblage of **N**umerous **U**tilities for **Bi**g **S**implicial Data Structures

ANUBIS is a C++ library of high-performance algorithms for computing topological invariants of point sets and simplicial topological spaces. It can be used as a tool for topological data analysis or plotting computer generated triangulations of given surfaces.

## Why: Functionality and Motivation
The motivation consists in the will for a as flexible as possible toolbox for analyzing the behavior of simplicial topological spaces under certain transformations. Further we want to be able to simplify large complexes to such a degree that they are actually calculable.
The main focus is to use state-of-the-art data structures to tackle this goal. Further there are some elaborate algorithms involved to speed up this computations as far as possible.

### Binding with Python
I tried to make porting this library to python as easy as possible in order to use it in a more flexible environment. The linkage to a C++ interface preserves the execution speed while offering a more easy to use interface to the user.
Boost.Python or ctypes library from python standard library
